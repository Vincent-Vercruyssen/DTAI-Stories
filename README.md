# ML instructions: How to add new content

## 1. Fork the repository
Create a copy of the website repository by forking the repository to your own GitHub

## 2. Create a new article
1. Install Hugo
2. Run the following command, replacing "name_of_the_author" with your name and "name_of_the_post" with the post title

   `hugo new --kind post post/name_of_the_author/name_of_the_post`
   
   This will create the new page with the current date already filled
3. Go to `content/posts/name_of_the_author/name_of_the_post`
4. Edit the index.md with your post, written in Mark down

## 3. Add yourself as an author
If you're writing your first article, you should probably also make a nice author page for yourself.

1. Go to the `content/authors` folder
2. Copy the `demo` folder
3. Rename the folder to your name and lastname, separated with a dash, e.g. `luc-deraedt` (do not an underscore)
4. Update the `_index.md` file with your personal information

## 4. Send a pull request
Now go back to the main repository, and send a pull request from your forked repository.
One of the website admins will then pull your article in, and rebuild the website.

Thanks for posting about your research!
